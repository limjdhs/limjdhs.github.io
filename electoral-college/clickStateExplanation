# begin 0
Define (def) a function (a section of a program to do a specific task) called click_state that takes the input of state. 
# end 0
# begin 1 
    Make the variable new_color, which is a change from the current color. Also change variable of current_color to the value of new_color. 
# end 1
# begin 2
    Start a conditional (a tool in programming that's like a decision tree). We're checking to see if the new_color is blue.
# end 2
# begin 3
        If new_color is blue, set the variable for the Republican vote (rep_vote) to less than half (0.49, or 49%). Also change the slider value (to 49 out of 100).
# end 3
# begin 4
    If new_color was not blue but is red, we'll do the next step.
# end 4
# begin 5
        If new_color is red, set the Republican vote (rep_vote) to greater than half (0.51, or 51%). Also change the slider value (to 51 out of 100). 
# end 5
# begin 6
    This is the last step of the conditional, for if new_color was not blue or red.
# end 6
# begin 7
        If new_color is not blue or red, it must be gray for neutral. Set the Republican vote (rep_vote) and the slider value to exactly half. 
# end 7
# begin 8
    We changed the variable for the Republican vote, but not the electoral or popular bars. The next step is to run functions that will update these bars.
# end 8
